# MeteoCompare
MeteoCompare is an Android APP that compares the weather of two locations.

This was my final project for my 2 year HNC, using the knowledge acquired through the course.

## Languages and technologies used

While developing this project, I used Java as programming language, SQLite as DB, made use of an API to collect and transform the data and XML to set up all the layouts.

I learnt a lot about Java and how to interact with a DB.
Also, creating an UI for Android was a huge challenge for me.
